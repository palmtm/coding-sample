# JavaScript Code Sample

This folder contains a single JavaScript code sample that I developed at Techberry as part of an API for an application used by the HR department. The sample includes internal function calls (`TBSheetUtils.query` and `PluginsUtils`) that are proprietary to the firm.

*Note: Permission to share this code sample has been obtained from Techberry.*
